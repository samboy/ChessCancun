This is a version of ChessMerida where:

* The font images were converted in to high resolution PNG images
* The PNG images were converted in to SVG images using Inkscape
* The two fairy pieces from Capablanca Chess have been added

The following text looks like the starting position for Finesse
Chess in the ChessCancun font:

```

$ + + + + +%

$RnAbDkBqNr%

```

The above will look like this in a word processing document:
