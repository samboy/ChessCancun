This is a version of ChessMerida where:

* The font images were converted in to high resolution PNG images
* The PNG images were converted in to SVG images using Inkscape
* The two fairy pieces from Capablanca Chess have been added

The following text looks like the starting position for Finesse
Chess in the ChessCancun font:

```

The above will look like this in a word processing document:

Here is how the opening position in Classic chess would look using 
this font:

Upper case letters are pieces on dark squares; lower case letters
are pieces on light squares.  The pieces are as follows:

R: White Rook
T: Black Rook
N: White Knight
M: Black Knight
B: White Bishop
V: Black Bishop
Q: White Queen
W: Black Queen
K: White King
L: Black King
P: White Pawn
O: Black Pawn

Support for two fairy pieces is also provided:

A: White Archbishop (Knight + Bishop)
S: Black Archbishop
D: White Marshal (Knight + Rook)
F: Black Marshal

A space is an empty white square; a `+` is an empty black square.

It’s possible to put a box around the board:

The top left corner is a `!`; the top is a `"`; the top right corner
is a `#`, left side is a `$`, the right side is a `%`, the bottom
left corner is a `/`, the bottom is a `(`, and the bottom right corner
is a `)`.
