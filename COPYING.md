This work is public domain.

In more detail: This work is derived from ChessMerida, which is a font
released in the late 1990s under a “freeware” license:

>The font is freeware, I hope it is useful for the chess buddies. If you 
>want to repay us, you can send us some other fonts for creating chess
>diagrams (we are collecting them).

However, as per US copyright law, only the vector instructions for the
font can be copyrighted.  The forms of the chess figurines are not subject
to copyright.  As per [the law Stack 
Exchange](https://archive.ph/20260208233651/https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52559/can-i-use-chess-diagrams-in-my-book-without-infringing-any-copyrights-having-to)

>if the diagrams were represented using bitmaps [...] that would merely 
>be a representation of the appearance and not include Marroquin’s 
>creative work

Hence, this repo does not include any copied vector representations,
neither those made by Marroquin nor by the book he got the visual
images from.  All SVG and other vector representations are derived 
from the raster images in the PNG directory.

In addition, it is my understanding that Marroquin does not feel he
requires any compensation for this font, since he talks about it being
free to use; any donations are optional.  Indeed, if I could locate
Marroquin, I would give him a donation.

Because of this, all files here are public domain, free of any and all
copyright restrictions.

Since the font is over 25 years old, any design patents or other IP
protecting the appearance of this font in some jurisdictions has expired.
