This work is public domain.

In more detail: This work is derived from ChessMerida, which is a font
released in the late 1990s under a “freeware” license:

>The font is freeware, I hope it is useful for the chess buddies. If you

However, as per US copyright law, only the vector instructions for the
font can be copyrighted.  The forms of the chess figurines are not subject
to copyright.  As per [the law Stack 
Exchange](https://archive.ph/20260208233651/https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52559/can-i-use-chess-diagrams-in-my-book-without-infringing-any-copyrights-having-to)

Hence, this repo does not include any vector representations, neither
those made by Señor Marroquin nor by the book he got the visual images
from.

Because of this, all files here are public domain, free of any and all
copyright restrictions.

Since the font is over 25 years old, any design patents or other IP
protecting the appearance of this font in some jurisdictions has expired.
